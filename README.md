## Overview of the analysis:
A webpage and dynamic table were created to analyze UFO sighting data by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria (city, state, country, and shape) at the same time.

## Results:
Performing a search for the data is easy. Convenient placeholders of text within the table filters display the criteria of which the user will need to type what they are looking for. For example, the date format is "1/10/2010." The user will need to type the date in the same composition. After entering the details you are looking for, simply press enter or click outside of the search field to filter the data.

#### Filter Search

If you are not finding the data you are looking for, simply delete the entries and press enter or click outside the box. You can also replace the text already typed into the field.

## Summary:
This website is easy enough to use, however, I do believe changes can be made to make the site more user friendly and intuitive.

### Drawbacks I found in the design:
The filter search criteria is very specific. The locations are all case sensitive. Intuition tells one to capitalize proper nouns like cities and states. This could create confusion or make the user think the data they are looking for is not there, simply by typing it wrong. 

![Filter Search Bad](https://github.com/jstearns1988/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/incorrect%20criteria.png?raw=true)

The user has to hit their Enter key or click outside the box to filter the search. Nothing on the webpage specifies which action needs to be taken to begin the search. This can confuse the user, or even make them believe the website does not work.

![What do I do](https://github.com/jstearns1988/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/what%20now.png?raw=true)

Curiosity may be enough to make this site fun and interesting, but it would take a lot of reading through the unfiltered data for the user to see all of the possibilities and combinations of data they can filter through. Because they have to free-type the data they are looking for without suggestions or a dropdown, this could make our site less desirable.

### Recommendations for further development
The filter search can be edited to allow multiple case types so lower-case is not the only option. It could also allow for different date formats, which would be especially helpful for our users who do not use the United States date format. A change to the date format could also eliminate any confusion if someone types a day as "07" instead of "7." The filter search currently will not allow for a zero before the number if the day or month is one digit.

I think a button at the bottom of the search or text above the filters advising to press enter or click outside the box when ready would be a way to make the site more user friendly. This way we are not excluding those who don't automatically know they need to press the enter key to search. This website should be for everyone!

Finally, I would add dropdown lists to the location and shape searches in addition to free-typing. This way, a user can see their perimeters without having to view the large, unfiltered data table. This could be more efficient if someone is doing research with a limited amount of time.
